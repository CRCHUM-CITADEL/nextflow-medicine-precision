## PR checklist

- [ ] This comment contains a description of changes (with reason).
- [ ] If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
- [ ] Make sure your code lints (`pre-commit run -a`).
- [ ] Ensure the test suite passes (`nextflow run . -profile test,apptainer --outdir <OUTDIR>`).
- [ ] Check for unexpected warnings in debug mode (`nextflow run . -profile debug,test,apptainer --outdir <OUTDIR>`).
- [ ] `README.md` is updated (including new tool citations and authors/contributors).
